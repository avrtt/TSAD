This software utilizes a dynamic threshold generation model for anomaly detection, which is suitable for real-time anomaly detection of massive KPI data in Internet enterprises. The algorithm can adaptively extract time series cycle information and provide appropriate anomaly detection thresholds, effectively suppressing the occurrence of alarm storms while ensuring alarm recall.
